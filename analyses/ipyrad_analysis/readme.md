This directory houses ipyrad assembly files. Parameters files (with the prefix "params") contain the settings used by ipyrad to perform the assembly. There is one of these files for each pool (A-L) that is used to demultiplex each pool in step one of ipyrad. For subsequent steps, the file `params-data3.txt` was used to generate the final `data3` assembly. Output files generated by ipyrad, as well as files generated by subsequent R analyses, are located in the subdirectory `data3_outfiles`. The assembly workflow is best viewed in [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jldimond/Branching-Porites/blob/master/notebooks/ipyrad_assembly.ipynb).
